# Generating COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Images Using DCGAN and WGAN-GP

This project implements and compares Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) for generating synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The goal is to address class imbalance in medical image datasets and improve classification model performance.

## Features

- Implementation of DCGAN and WGAN-GP architectures
- Generation of synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images
- Hyperparameter tuning and comparison
- Evaluation using Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) score
- Integration with a DenseNet161 classifier for performance assessment

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install torch torchvision PIL numpy matplotlib tqdm scipy mlxtend sklearn
```

## Usage

1. Download the COVID-19_Radiography_Dataset folder at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
2. Run the notebook `gan_project.ipynb`

Note: The original code was developed and tested in Google Colab. For optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to run this code in the Google Colab environment.
